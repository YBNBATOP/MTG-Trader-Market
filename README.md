# General

This project was being worked on for the course of learning .NET fundamentals as part of the lecture course in the 4th semester of my bachelor degree.

This project has yet much more potential, however it is not planned to be worked on in the nearest future, and implemented the other missing features that were initially thought of.

# Demonstration

Here is the video that I made to demonstrate the possibilities of the web application:

# Personal implication

Here I want to specify the main parts that I worked on and that were requirements for the project:
- Blazor sessions (easiest implementation for Blazor sessions with Blazor Session Storage)
- Overall design for main pages, card pages (overview + details page), main idea for the purpose of the website.
- Modifying the initial database to add the functionality needed (for future non-working features)
- Card filtering system
